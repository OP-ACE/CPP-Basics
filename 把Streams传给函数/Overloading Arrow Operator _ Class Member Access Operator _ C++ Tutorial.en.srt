00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,069
hi this is Anil and welcome to the video

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,020
tutorial for the learning lag on Cypress

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,480
plus programming so in this tutorial

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,360
we're going to learn how to overload the

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,910
class member access operator so this

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,279
class member access operator is one of

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,380
the special operators available in C++

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,930
you know it is nothing but the arrow

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,750
operator so this arrow operator is a

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,390
point operator and also called the class

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,210
member operator so this operator is

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,149
considered as a unary operator when

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,130
overloading so the general usage of this

14
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,620
arrow operator is you know we used to

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,600
have an object and then the arrow

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,820
operator and then the element so here

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,620
the object is the object that activates

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,770
the call so this object is going to call

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,890
the operator function for this arrow

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,899
operator that we write and also when you

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,260
overload this arrow operator or the

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,539
class member access operator the

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,289
operator function must return a pointer

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,010
to an object of the class where we

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,250
overload this arrow operator

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:14,490
so here the element must be some member

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,900
accessible within the object so now you

28
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,420
know we can see how to overload this

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,950
operator in our program so just for the

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,070
demonstration purpose I have already

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,770
created a class in this program and we

32
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,789
have a class called marks and we have a

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,780
member called mark and we have a public

34
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,310
constructor and which is going to take

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,130
one value and it's going to initialize

36
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,200
the member mark and also we have a

37
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,110
public method you know which is going to

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,810
print out the value store in this member

39
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,909
mark all right the next thing that we're

40
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,399
going to do is we can have overload the

41
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,399
arrow operator or we going to overload

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,890
the class member access operator so this

43
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,960
class member access operator is one of

44
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,630
the special operator available in C++

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,789
and that's why we cannot use friend

46
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,070
function to overload this operator and

47
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,040
also the operator function that we can

48
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,399
write must be a non-static member of

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,060
this class all right now here first we

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,250
need to specify the return type

51
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,319
and also I told you that you know the

52
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,990
operator function must return a pointer

53
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,119
to an object of the class where this

54
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:23,209
operator function is defined and that's

55
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,080
why it's going to be a pointer of this

56
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:30,080
class marks marks star and then the

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,739
keyword operator and then the operator

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,290
symbol which is this arrow operator and

59
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:38,840
then a pair of parentheses and between

60
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,269
that parenthesis no parameters that's

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,519
because you know this arrow operator or

62
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:46,160
this class member access operator is

63
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,230
considered as a unary operator and the

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,799
only operand is going to work on will be

65
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,679
implicitly passed by the C++ so here

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,470
inside this operator function we just

67
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,470
gonna return the this pointer so it's

68
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,250
going to be returned and this that's it

69
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:06,140
so now we have overloaded the arrow

70
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,300
operator or the class member access

71
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,730
operator next we're going to create an

72
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,600
object of this class marks and let's say

73
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:18,130
marks and Anil smoke the object name and

74
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:21,590
we can initialize that for example 65

75
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:24,109
now we can access this what's your mark

76
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,900
methyl since it is public you know this

77
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:30,230
mark is private by using the dot

78
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,299
operator and to do that we need to write

79
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,018
the object name that is Anil's mark and

80
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:39,459
then dot operator and then the method in

81
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,459
that is was your mark

82
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:47,200
alright so now we have overloaded this

83
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,929
error operator that's why we can use

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,899
this operator just like the way we were

85
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,180
using this dot operator so we can also

86
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,940
access this by using the arrow operator

87
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,070
so we don't have a pointer here and

88
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,160
first I'm going to run this and then I'm

89
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,108
going to expand it so build and run all

90
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,739
right now you guys can see we got a hey

91
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:12,709
I got 65 marks and hey I got 65 marks so

92
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,780
we have accessed this member metal was

93
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,238
your mark by using the dot operator and

94
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,228
arrow operator so here when we use this

95
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,209
arrow operator

96
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,340
you know this onion smoke is going to

97
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,900
call the operator function and this

98
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:28,190
object will be passed as a current

99
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,229
object to this operator function so the

100
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,080
this pointer is going to contain the

101
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,479
address of this object passed and that's

102
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,909
why you know this operator is gonna

103
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,919
return the pointer so here when we use

104
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,690
this dot operator we are referring that

105
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,150
through object because of this

106
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,580
overloaded arrow operator you know we

107
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,919
get the address here because of the

108
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,169
return statement of this this here so

109
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,659
that's why we can access that just like

110
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:59,479
the way we were using the the pointer

111
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,550
and the arrow operator so this is how

112
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:04,669
you guys can overload the arrow operator

113
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,919
or the class member axis operator in C++

114
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:09,349
